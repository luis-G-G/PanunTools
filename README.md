# Panuntools

1) [Calculate Ownership](docs/README_CalculateOwnership.md)
2) [Create Fire Progression](docs/README_CreateFireProgression.md)
3) [GISS Workflow Assistant](docs/README_CalculateEventGeometry_CopyGDB.md)
4) [Multi Export PDF](docs/README_MultiExportPDF.md)
5) [Update Fire Edge](docs/README_UpdateFireEdge.md)


In the future some of these tools may be migrated to the [Community GISS Tools](https://github.com/smHooper/giss_community_tools) repository, but for now it was easier to just create my own.

Feel free to contact me at mpanunto@blm.gov with any comments, questions, or error reports.
