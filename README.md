# Panuntools

In the future some of these tools may be migrated to the GISS Community Toolbox, but for now it was easier to simply create my own repository.

1) [Calculate Ownership](docs/README_CalculateOwnership.md)
2) [Create Fire Progression](docs/README_CreateFireProgression.md)
3) [GISS Workflow Assistant](docs/README_CalculateEventGeometry_CopyGDB.md)
4) [Multi Export PDF](docs/README_MultiExportPDF.md)
5) [Update Fire Edge](docs/README_UpdateFireEdge.md)


Feel free to contact me at mpanunto@blm.gov with any comments, questions, or error reports.
