# Update Fire Edge

Don't you hate having to meticulously split, delete, and swap the feature categories of Contained Line and Fire Edge during the early morning perimeter update? Well with the Update Fire Edge tool, you can simply dump all the old Fire Edge features, and quickly paste in an updated Fire Edge feature that conforms nicely with the new fire perimeter and existing Contained Line.
