# Update Fire Edge

Don't you hate having to meticulously split, delete, and change the feature categories of Contained Line and Fire Edge features during the early morning perimeter update? Imagine a world where you can simply dump all the old Fire Edge features, and quickly paste in a new feature that conforms nicely with the fire perimeter and existing Contained Line. That's why I use the Update Fire Edge tool!
