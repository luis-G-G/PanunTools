# Dissolve Explode Perimeter Edge

Basic tool that assists the GISS in tidying up their perimeter edge (Contained Line & Fire Edge).

### How does it work?

The tool first performs a selection of Contained Line and Fire Edge features with the user specified IncidentName. Once selected, these features are dissolved, and then exploded (Multipart to Singlepart). The original Contained Line and Fire Edge features are then deleted, and replaced with the newly exploded features.

### Users have two options:
1. Create a FireProgression feature class by processing all perimeters
2. Create a FireProgression feature class by processing only the latest perimeter
    - Requires a previously generated FireProgression feature class
