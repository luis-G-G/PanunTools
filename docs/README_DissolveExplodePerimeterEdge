# Dissolve Explode Perimeter Edge

Basic tool that assists the GISS in keeping their perimeter edge clean (Contained Line & Fire Edge).

### How does it work?

The tool builds a fire progression by iteratively projecting, clipping, erasing, and merging the perimeters inside an incident's Progression GDB. For this tool to work, the fire perimeter feature classes within the incident's Progression GDB must follow a "IncidentName_YYYYMMDD_HHMM" naming convention, as shown in the below screenshot. The tool parses perimeter dates & times from the filenames, and uses this information to create some useful labeling/symbolization fields. It is hardcoded to assume that the datetimes are the last 13 characters of the filenames.

### Users have two options:
1. Create a FireProgression feature class by processing all perimeters
2. Create a FireProgression feature class by processing only the latest perimeter
    - Requires a previously generated FireProgression feature class
